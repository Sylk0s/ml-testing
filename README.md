# ml-testing

This is just a repo to test random machine learning stuff. Ive just started getting into it and wanna go ahead and implement a simple neural network to get a feel for the process before I learn tensorflow. This is probably gonna be a bunch of garbage so don't judge my crappy code :) If I actually make something cool ill probably move it to another repo.
